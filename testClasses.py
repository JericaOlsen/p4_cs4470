"""Test case framework for Pacman AI project autograding.

This module provides the core test case infrastructure for autograding student 
submissions in the Pacman AI project, including:
- Base TestCase class for implementing specific test types
- Question class for grouping related test cases
- Test execution and scoring functionality
- Support for test case configuration and validation

Changes by George Rudolph 30 Nov 2024:
- Added comprehensive module docstring
- Added type hints throughout
- Improved class and method documentation
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Standardized code formatting
