"""
bustersGhostAgents.py
--------------------
This module implements specialized ghost agents for the Pacman Busters variant game.

Key components:
- StationaryGhost: A ghost that remains in one place
- DispersingGhost: A ghost that tries to spread away from other ghosts

The ghosts use different strategies to either stay still or disperse through
the maze based on configurable probabilities.
