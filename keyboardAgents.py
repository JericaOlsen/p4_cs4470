Keyboard control module for the Pacman game.

This module provides agents that can be controlled via keyboard input.
The KeyboardAgent class allows controlling Pacman using either WASD keys
or arrow keys for movement. The module includes:

1. KeyboardAgent - Basic keyboard-controlled agent
2. KeyboardAgent2 - Alternative keyboard agent for 2-player games

The module works with game.py and graphicsUtils.py to handle user input
and agent movement in the game environment.

Changes by George Rudolph 30 Nov 2024:
- Verified compatibility with Python 3.13
- Enhanced module documentation
- Added type hints throughout
- Improved class and method documentation
- Added input validation
