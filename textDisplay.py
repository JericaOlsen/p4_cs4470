"""Text-based display module for Pacman game visualization.

This module provides text-based visualization capabilities for the Pacman game,
including:
- Null graphics implementation for headless execution
- Basic text display of game state and moves
- Configurable display timing and update frequency

Changes by George Rudolph 30 Nov 2024:
- Added comprehensive module docstring
- Added type hints throughout
- Improved class and method documentation
- Enhanced display formatting
- Standardized code style
