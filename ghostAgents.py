"""
ghostAgents.py
-------------
This module implements various ghost agents for the Pacman game, including random
and directional ghosts that either chase or flee from Pacman.

The ghosts use different strategies to move through the maze, from completely random
movement to more sophisticated path planning and behavior patterns.
